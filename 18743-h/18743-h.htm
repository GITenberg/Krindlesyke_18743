In the printed book, all advertising and related matter was placed
before the main text; the Epilogue was the final page of the book.
Most of this front matter has been moved to the end of the e-text.
<br>
Unusual spellings are assumed to be intentional unless there is strong
reason to believe otherwise. The use of parentheses in stage directions
is as in the original.<br>
The word “thon” (a regional variant of “yon”) is used several times in
the text. The pronoun “thou” does not occur.

<p>
<span class = "smallcaps">On</span> the occasion of an obscure dramatic
presentation, an early and rudimentary draft of Book I. was published in
1910. It has since been entirely re-written. Book&nbsp;II., written
1919-22, has not been printed hitherto. Though the work was not
conceived with a view to stage-production, the author reserves the
acting rights.</p>

<p>
It may be added that, while “Krindlesyke” is not in dialect, it has been
flavoured with a sprinkling of local words; but as these are, for the
most part, words expressive of emotion, rather than words conveying
information, the sense of them should be easily gathered even by the
south-country reader.</p>

Four bleak stone walls, an eaveless, bleak stone roof,<br>
Like a squared block of native crag, it stands,<br>
Hunched, on skirlnaked, windy fells, aloof:<br>
Yet, was it built by patient human hands:<br>
Hands, that have long been dust, chiselled each stone,<br>
And bedded it secure; and from the square<br>
Squat chimneystack, hither and thither blown,<br>
The reek of human fires still floats in air,<br>
And perishes, as life on life burns through.<br>
Squareset and stark to every blast that blows,<br>
It bears the brunt of time, withstands anew<br>
Wildfires of tempest and league-scouring snows,<br>
Dour and unshaken by any mortal doom,<br>
Timeless, unstirred by any mortal dream:<br>
And ghosts of reivers gather in the gloom<br>
About it, muttering, when the lych-owls scream.</p>

<p class = "stagedir first">
Krindlesyke is a remote shepherd’s cottage on the Northumbrian fells, at
least three miles from any other habitation. It consists of two rooms, a
but and a ben. <span class = "charname">Ezra Barrasford</span>, an old
herd, blind and decrepit, sits in an armchair in the but, or
living-room, near the open door, on a mild afternoon in April. <span
class = "charname">Eliza Barrasford</span>, his wife, is busy, making
griddle-cakes over the peat fire.</p>

<p class = "speaker">
<span class = "charname">Eliza</span> <span class = "stagedir">(glancing
at the wag-at-the-wa’)</span>:</p>
<p class = "line">
It’s hard on three o’clock, and they’ll be home<br>
Before so very long now.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line three">
Eh, what’s that?</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line">
You’re growing duller every day. I said<br>
They’d soon be home now.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line two">
They? And who be they?</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line">
My faith, you’ve got a memory like a milk-sile!<br>
You’ve not forgotten Jim’s away to wed?<br>
You’re not that dull.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line two">
We cannot all be needles:<br>
And some folk’s tongues are sharper than their wits.<br>
Yet, till thon spirt of hot tar blinded me,<br>
No chap was cuter in all the countryside,<br>
Or better at a bargain; and it took<br>
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
A nimble tongue to bandy words with mine.<br>
You’d got to be up betimes to get round Ezra:<br>
And none was a shrewder judge of ewes, or women.<br>
My wits just failed me once, the day I married:<br>
But, you’re an early riser, and your tongue<br>
Is always up before you, and with an edge,<br>
Unblunted by the dewfall, and as busy<br>
As a scythe in the grass at Lammas. So Jim’s away<br>
To wed, is he, the limb? I thought he’d gone<br>
For swedes; though now, I mind some babblement<br>
About a wedding: but, nowadays, words tumble<br>
Through my old head like turnips through a slicer;<br>
And naught I ken who the bowdykite’s to wed&mdash;<br>
Some bletherskite he’s picked up in a ditch,<br>
Some fond fligary flirtigig, clarty-fine,<br>
Who’ll turn a slattern-shrew and a cap-river<br>
Within a week, if I ken aught of Jim.<br>
Unless ... Nay, sure, ’twas Judith Ellershaw.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line">
No, no; you’re dull, indeed. It’s Phœbe Martin.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line">
Who’s Phœbe Martin? I ken naught of her.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line">
And I, but little.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line two">
Some trapsing tatterwallops,<br>
I’ll warrant. Well, these days, the lads are like<br>
The young cockgrouse, who doesn’t consult his dad<br>
Before he mates. In my&mdash;yet, come to think,<br>
I didn’t say overmuch. My dad and mammy<br>
Scarce kenned her name when I sprung my bride on them;<br>
Just loosed on them a gisseypig out of a poke<br>
They’d heard no squeak of. They’d to thole my choice,<br>
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
Lump it or like it. I’d the upper hand then:<br>
And well they kenned their master. No tawse to chide,<br>
Nor apron-strings to hold young Ezra then:<br>
His turn had come; and he was cock of the midden,<br>
And no braw cockerel’s hustled him from it yet,<br>
For all their crowing. The blind old bird’s still game.<br>
They’ve never had his spirit, the young cheepers,<br>
Not one; and Jim’s the lave of the clutch; and he<br>
Will never lord it at Krindlesyke till I’m straked.<br>
But this what’s-her-name the gaby’s bringing ...</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line four">
Phœbe.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line">
A posical name; I never heard the like.<br>
She’ll be a flighty faggit, mark my words.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line">
She’s only been here once before; and now<br>
She’ll be here all the time. I’ll find it strange<br>
With another woman in the house. Needs must<br>
Get used to it. Your mother found it strange,<br>
Likely ... It’s my turn now, and long in coming.<br>
Perhaps, that makes it harder. I’ve got set<br>
Like a vane, when the wind’s blown east so long, it’s clogged<br>
With dust, and cannot whisk with the chopping breeze.<br>
’Twill need a wrench to shift my bent; for change<br>
Comes sore and difficult at my time of life.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line">
Ay, you may find your nose put out of joint,<br>
If she’s a spirited wench.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line three">
Due east it’s blown<br>
Since your mother died. She barely outlived my coming;<br>
And never saw a grandchild. I wonder ... Yet,<br>
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
I spared her all I could. Ay, that was it:<br>
She couldn’t abide to watch me trying to spare her,<br>
Another woman doing her work, finoodling<br>
At jobs she’d do so smartly, tidying her hearth,<br>
Using her oven, washing her cups and saucers,<br>
Scouring her tables, redding up her rooms,<br>
Handling her treasures, and wearing out her gear.<br>
And now, another, wringing out my dishclout,<br>
And going about my jobs in her own fashion;<br>
Turning my household, likely, howthery-towthery,<br>
While I sit mum. But it takes forty years’<br>
Steady east wind to teach some folk; and then<br>
They’re overdried to profit by their learning.<br>
And so, without a complaint, and keeping her secrets,<br>
Your mother died with patient, quizzical eyes,<br>
Half-pitying, fixed on mine; and dying, left<br>
Krindlesyke and its gear to its new mistress.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line">
A woman, she was. You’ve never had her hand<br>
At farls and bannocks; and her singing-hinnies<br>
Fair melted in the mouth&mdash;not sad and soggy<br>
As yours are like to be. She’d no habnab<br>
And hitty-missy ways; and she’d turn to,<br>
At shearing-time, and clip with any man.<br>
She never spared herself.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line three">
And died at forty,<br>
As white and worn as an old table-cloth,<br>
Darned, washed, and ironed to a shred of cobweb,<br>
Past mending; while your father was sixty-nine<br>
Before he could finish himself, soak as he might.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line">
Don’t you abuse my father. A man, he was&mdash;<br>
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
No fonder of his glass than a man should be.<br>
Few like him now: I’ve not his guts, and Jim’s<br>
Just a lamb’s head, gets half-cocked on a thimble,<br>
And mortal, swilling an eggcupful; a gill<br>
Would send him randy, reeling to the gallows.<br>
Dad was the boy! Got through three bottles a day,<br>
And never turned a hair, when his own master,<br>
Before we’d to quit Rawridge, because the dandy<br>
Had put himself outside of all his money&mdash;<br>
Teeming it down his throat in liquid gold,<br>
Swallowing stock and plenishing, gear and graith.<br>
A bull-trout’s gape and a salamander thrapple&mdash;<br>
A man, and no mistake!</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line three">
A man; and so,<br>
She died; and since your mother was carried out,<br>
Hardly a woman’s crossed the threshold, and none<br>
Has slept the night at Krindlesyke. Forty-year,<br>
With none but men! They’ve kept me at it; and now<br>
Jim’s bride’s to take the work from my hands, and do<br>
Things over that I’ve done over for forty-year,<br>
Since I took them from your mother&mdash;things some woman’s<br>
Been doing at Krindlesyke since the first bride<br>
Came home.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line one">
Three hundred years since the first herd<br>
Cut peats for that hearth’s kindling. Set alow,<br>
Once and for all, it’s seen a wheen lives burn<br>
Black-out: and when we, too, lie in the house<br>
That never knew housewarming, ’twill be glowing.<br>
Ay! and some woman’s tongue’s been going it,<br>
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
Like a wag-at-the-wa’, in this steading, three hundred years,<br>
Tick-tocking the same things over.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line three">
Dare say, we’ll manage:<br>
A decent lass&mdash;though something in her eye,<br>
I couldn’t quite make out. Hardly Jim’s sort ...<br>
But, who can ever tell why women marry?<br>
And Jim ...</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line one">
Takes after me: and wenches buzz<br>
Round a handsome lad, as wasps about a bunghole.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line">
Though now they only see skin-deep, those eyes<br>
Will search the marrow. Jim will have his hands full,<br>
Unless she’s used to menfolk and their ways,<br>
And past the minding. She’d the quietness<br>
That’s a kind of pride, and yet, not haughty&mdash;held<br>
Her head like a young blood-mare, that’s mettlesome<br>
Without a touch of vice. She’ll gan her gait<br>
Through this world, and the next. The bit in her teeth,<br>
There’ll be no holding her, though Jim may tug<br>
The snaffle, till he’s tewed. I’ve kenned that look<br>
In women’s eyes, and mares’, though, with a difference.<br>
And Jim&mdash;yet she seemed fond enough of Jim:<br>
His daffing’s likely fresh to her, though his jokes<br>
Are last week’s butter. Last week’s! For forty-year<br>
I’ve tholed them, all twice-borrowed, from dad and granddad,<br>
And rank, when I came to Krindlesyke, to find<br>
Life, the same jobs and same jests over and over.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line">
A notion, that, to hatch, full-fledged and crowing!<br>
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
You must have brooded, old clocker.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line three">
True enough,<br>
Marriage means little more than a new gown<br>
To some: but Phœbe’s not a fancicle tauntril,<br>
With fingers itching to hansel new-fangled flerds.<br>
Why she’d wed ...</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line one">
Tuts! Girls take their chance. And you’d<br>
Conceit enough of Jim, at one time&mdash;proud<br>
As a pipit that’s hatched a cuckoo: and if the gowk<br>
Were half as handsome as I&mdash;you ken, yourself,<br>
You needed no coaxing: I wasted little breath<br>
Whistling to heel: you came at the first “Isca!”</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line">
Who kens what a lass runs away from, crazed to quit<br>
Home, at all hazards, little realizing<br>
It’s life, itself, she’s trying to escape;<br>
And plodging deeper.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line two">
Trust a wench for kenning.<br>
I’ve to meet the wife who’d be a maid again:<br>
Once in the fire, no wife, though she may crackle<br>
On the live coals, leaps back to the frying-pan.<br>
It’s against nature.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line two">
Maybe: and yet, somehow,<br>
Phœbe seemed different.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line two">
I’ve found little difference<br>
Betwixt one gimmer and another gimmer,<br>
When the ram’s among them. But, where does she hail from?</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line">
Allendale way. Jim met her at Martinmas fair.</p>

We met ...</p>

<span class = "pagenum">10</span>

Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line one">
Ay, fairs have much to answer for.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line">
I thought ’twas Judith Ellershaw.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line four">
God forbid<br>
’Twas Judith I’d to share with: though Jim fancied<br>
The lass, at one time. He’s had many fancies:<br>
Light come, light go, it’s always been with Jim.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line">
And I was gay when I was young&mdash;as brisk<br>
As a yearling tup with the ewes, till I’d the pains,<br>
Like red-hot iron, clamping back and thighs.<br>
My heart’s a younker’s still; but even love<br>
Gives in, at last, to rheumatics and lumbago.<br>
Now, I’m no better than an old bell-wether,<br>
A broken-winded, hirpling tattyjack<br>
That can do nothing but baa and baa and baa.<br>
I’d just to whistle for a wench at Jim’s age:<br>
And Jim’s ...</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>

His father’s son.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line three">
He’s never had<br>
My spirit. No woman’s ever bested me.<br>
For all his bluster, he’s a gaumless nowt,<br>
With neither guts nor gall. He just butts blindly&mdash;<br>
A woolly-witted ram, bashing his horns,<br>
And spattering its silly brains out on a rock:<br>
No backbone&mdash;any trollop could twiddle him<br>
Round her little finger: just the sort a doxy,<br>
Or a drop too much, sets dancing, heels in air:<br>
He’s got the gallows’ brand. But none of your sons<br>
Has a head for whisky or wenches; and not one<br>
Has half my spunk, my relish. I’d not trust<br>
Their judgment of a ewe, let alone a woman:<br>
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
But I could size a wench up, at a glance;<br>
And Judith ...</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line one">
Ay: but Krindlesyke would be<br>
A muckheap-lie-on, with that cloffy slut<br>
For mistress. But she flitted one fine night.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line">
Rarely the shots of the flock turn lowpy-dyke;<br>
Likelier the tops have the spunk to run ramrace;<br>
And I think no worse ...</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line two">
Her father turned her out,<br>
’Twas whispered; and he’s never named her, since:<br>
And no one’s heard a word. I couldn’t thole<br>
The lass. She’d big cow-eyes: there’s little good<br>
In that sort. Jim’s well shot of her; he’ll not<br>
Hear tell of her: that sort can always find<br>
Another man to fool: they don’t come back:<br>
Past’s past, with them.</p>

Bairn’s bairns at Krindlesyke, before I die.<br>
Six sons&mdash;and only the youngest of the bunch<br>
Left in the old home to do his parents credit.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>
<p class = "line">
Queer, all went wild, your sons, like collies bitten<br>
With a taste for mutton bleeding-hot. Cold lead<br>
Cures dogs of that kidney, peppering them one fine night<br>
From a chink in a stell; but, when they’re two-legged curs,<br>
They’ve a longer run; and, in the end, the gallows<br>
Don’t noose them, kicking and squealing like snarled rabbits,<br>
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
Dead-certain, as ’twould do in the good old days.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Eliza:</p>
<p class = "line">
You crack your gallows-jokes on your own sons&mdash;<br>
And each the spit of the father that drove them wild,<br>

Flogging them senseless, till their little bodies<br>
Were one blue bruise.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Ezra:</p>

I never larruped enough,<br>

That was the mischief. They should have had my dad&mdash;<br>

That took the bit in her teeth, and bolted: although<br>
You scarcely look it, either. Old Ezra used<br>
To mumble your name, when he was raiming on<br>
About the sovereigns Jim made off with: he missed<br>
The money more than the son&mdash;small blame to him:<br>
Though why grudge travelling-expenses to good-riddance?<br>
And still, ’twas shabby to pinch the lot: a case<br>
Of pot and kettle, but I’d have scorned to bag<br>
The lot, and leave the old folk penniless.<br>
’Twas hundreds Peter blabbed of&mdash;said our share<br>
Wouldn’t be missed&mdash;or I’d have never set foot<br>
In Krindlesyke; to think I walked into this trap<br>

Except by accident. I did ... and yet,<br>
I came. I had to come: the old witch drew me.<br>

Just stopping to curse Jim, when he called to mind<br>

Nid-nodding, Michael and I, just as the clock<br>

No streak of me. All Barrasford, I judged him:<br>

But she was dead; and so, I had to stay&mdash;<br>

A wet afternoon in May, six years later. The table is already set for
tea. <span class = "charname">Judith Ellershaw</span> sits, knitting, by
the hearth; a cradle with a young baby in it by her side. The outer door
is closed, but unlatched. Presently the unkempt head of a man appears
furtively at the window; then vanishes. The door is pushed stealthily
open: and <span class = "charname">Jim Barrasford</span>, ragged and
disreputable (and some twenty years older than when he married <span
class = "charname">Phœbe Martin</span>) stands on the threshold a
moment, eyeing <span class = "charname">Judith’s</span> unconscious back
in silence: then he speaks, limping towards her chair.</p>

<p class = "speaker charname">
Jim:</p>

Ay, Jim&mdash;<br>
No other, Judith. I’ll be bound you weren’t<br>
Just looking to see me: you seem overcome<br>
<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
By the unexpected pleasure. Your pardon, mistress,<br>
If I intrude. By crikes! But I’m no ghost<br>
To set you adither: you don’t see anything wrong&mdash;<br>
No, no! What should you see? I startled you.<br>
Happen I look a wee bit muggerishlike&mdash;<br>
A ragtag hipplety-clinch: but I’ve been travelling<br>
Mischancy roads; and I’m fair muggert-up.<br>
Yet, why should that stagnate you? Where’s the sense<br>
Of expecting a mislucket man like me<br>
To be as snod and spruce as a young shaver?<br>
But I’m all right: there’s naught amiss with Jim,<br>
Except too much of nothing in his belly.<br>
A good square meal, and a pipe, and a decent night’s rest,<br>
And I’ll be fit as a fiddle. I’ve hardly slept ...<br>
Well, now I’m home, I’ll make myself at home.</p>

You’re maiselt, to see a scarecrow stottering in&mdash;<br>
For plover’s eggs and heather-broth don’t sleek<br>

But still, what should there be to flabbergast you<br>
About a man’s returning to his home?<br>
Naught wrong in coming home, I hope? By gox,<br>
A poor lad can’t come home, but he’s cross-questioned,<br>

It’s I should be agape, to find you here:<br>
But no, I’m not surprised: you can’t surprise me:<br>
I’m a travelled man: I’ve seen the world; and so,<br>
Don’t look for gratitude. My eyes were opened,<br>
Once and for all, by Phœbe and you, that day&mdash;<br>
Nigh twenty-year since: and they’ve not been shut ...<br>
By gum, that’s so! it seems like twenty-year<br>
Since I’d a wink of sleep ... And, anyway,<br>
I’ve heard the story, all the goings-on;<br>
And a pretty tale it is: for I’d a drink,<br>
A sappy-crack with that old windywallops,<br>
Sep Shanks, in a bar at Bellingham: and he let out<br>
How you’d crawled back to Krindlesyke with your daughter&mdash;<br>
Our daughter, I should say: and she, no less,<br>
Married to Peter’s son: though how the deuce<br>
You picked him up, is more that I can fashion.<br>
Sep had already had his fill of cheerers,<br>
Before I met him; and that last rum-hot<br>
Was just the drop too much: and he got fuddled.<br>
Ay, Sep was mortal-clay, the addled egg:<br>
And I couldn’t make head or tail of his hiccuping,<br>
Though he tried to make himself plain: he did his best,<br>
Did Sep: I’ll say that for him&mdash;tried so hard<br>
To make himself plain, he got us both chucked out:<br>
And I left him in the gutter, trying still.</p>

Least so, by those who’ve taken the bread from their mouths,<br>

Coffins? Who muttered coffins? Let’s not talk<br>
Of coffins, Judith ... Shut in a black box!<br>
They couldn’t keep old Ezra in: the lid<br>
Flew off; and old granddaddy sat up, girning ...<br>
They had to screw him down ... And Solomon<br>
Slept with his fathers ... I wonder he could sleep,<br>
After the razzle-dazzle ... Concubines!<br>
’Twould take a pyramid to keep him down!<br>

The crazy clapper, seemingly ... But, coffins&mdash;<br>

To do with coffins? Let us talk of fires:<br>
I’ve always loved a fire: I’d set the world<br>
Alow for my delight, if it would burn.<br>
It’s such a soggy, sodden world to-day,<br>
I’m duberous I could kindle it with an izle:<br>
It might just smoulder with muckle funeral-plumes<br>
Of smoke, like coffin-elder ... And the blaze&mdash;<br>
The biggest flare-up ever I set eyes on,<br>
It was a kind of funeral, you might say&mdash;<br>
A fiery, flaming, roaring funeral,<br>
<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
A funeral such as I ... but no such luck<br>
For me in this world&mdash;likely, in the next!<br>
And anyway, it wouldn’t be much fun,<br>
If I couldn’t watch it, myself ... Ay, Long Nick Salkeld,<br>
And his old woman, Zillah, died together,<br>
The selfsame day, within an hour or so.<br>
’Twas on Spadeadam Waste we’d camped that time ...<br>
And kenning how they loved their caravan,<br>
And how they’d hate to leave it, or be parted<br>
From one another, even by a foot of earth,<br>
We laid them out, together, side by side,<br>
In the van, as they’d slept in it, night after night,<br>
For hard on fifty-year. We took naught out,<br>
And shifted naught: just burnished up the brasses,<br>
Till they twinkled as Zillah’d kept them, while she could ...<br>
And so, with not a coffin-board betwixt them,<br>
At dead of night we fired the caravan ...<br>
The flames leapt up; and roaring to the stars,<br>
As we stood round ... The flames leapt up, and roaring ...<br>
I hear them roaring now ... the flames ... I hear ...<br>
Flames roaring in my head ... I hear ... I hear ...<br>
And flying izles ... falling sparks ... I hear<br>

Gibson’s</span> new work is a tragic drama in blank verse, concerned
with three generations of a family of Northumbrian shepherds. The title,
‘Krindlesyke,’ is taken from the name of the lonely cottage on the fells
where they live and the incidents of the story pass.</p>

<p>While ‘Krindlesyke’ is not in dialect, it has been flavoured with a
sprinkling of local words; but as these are, for the most part, words
expressive of emotion, rather than words conveying information, the
sense of them should be easily gathered even by the south-country
reader.</p>


<h3 class = "ital">Some Press Opinions</h3>

<p class = "critic">
<i>The Poetry Review.</i>&mdash;‘A new book by Mr. Wilfrid Gibson must
always arouse interest, for his genius has been displayed in such varied
forms that one can only wonder what new development, what new blending
of his great qualities may appear.... In “Krindlesyke” he may be said to
have astounded us all by achieving the seemingly impossible combination
of the diverse qualities he has hitherto displayed separately.... Ezra
Barrasford and his sons appear, amidst the wreck they have made,
wonderfully convincing characters.... The women are no less
convincing&mdash;good-hearted, toil-worn Eliza, driven to “nagging” by
her husband and sons; Bell Haggard, a truly wonderful study; Judith, who
has learned much wisdom from bitter experience. As to the language, it
is wonderfully true to country life and character.’</p>

<p class = "critic">
<i>The Daily News.</i>&mdash;‘There is much breadth of vision and much
of that bitter wisdom that is yet half beauty in this poem.’</p>

<p class = "critic">
<i>Mr. Laurence Binyon in The Observer.</i>&mdash;‘“Krindlesyke” is at
once the most ambitious and the strongest work that Mr. Wilfrid Gibson
has given us. It is a dramatic poem, firmly designed, and carried out
with abundant energy and power.’</p>

<p class = "critic">
<i>The Times Literary Supplement.</i>&mdash;‘The poet of deep and
self-forgetful feeling must, we venture to think, survive when mannered
muses are forgotten. Mr. Gibson is such a poet.... It is his distinction
to belong to the school of Wordsworth in an age which is generally too
clever, hasty, and conscious to wait upon “the still sad music of
humanity.” ... “Krindlesyke” is a notable achievement of the sympathetic
imagination.’</p>

<p class = "critic">
<i>Prof. C. H. Herford in The Manchester Guardian.</i>&mdash;‘Bell’s
talk is full of salt and vivacity, a brilliant stream in which city
slang reinforces rustic idiom, and both are re-manipulated by
inexhaustible native wit. She is the most remarkable creation in a
gallery where not a single figure is indistinct or conventional.... Mr.
Gibson’s essay&mdash;for there is confessedly something experimental
about it&mdash;must be reckoned, with those of Mr. Abercrombie, to whom
“Krindlesyke” is dedicated, among the most remarkable dramatic poems of
our time.’</p>

<p class = "critic">
<i>The Aberdeen Journal.</i>&mdash;‘“Krindlesyke” is incontestably the
best work Mr. Gibson has so far given us. It is amazingly
good&mdash;vivid, sincere, living, felt in the marrow of his bones and
the beat of his heart.... Here are peasants that belong to a world as
true and as deeply felt as those of Hardy and Synge. They are provincial
only in the sense that Wordsworth’s dalesmen and women are provincial;
that is, they are, in the true sense, universal.... No recent work is
more worth reading.... Mr. Gibson has fashioned for his peasants the
rich, racy, coloured, vigorous speech that is essential to them. No
thing of book this.... As peasant talk it rings true; its rich tang is a
rare delight.’</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
